  # Allow the request to pass through. This is the default action.

  # @example Whitelist a domain

  #   }
  # @raise [Action]

  # @example Redirect google.com to duckduckgo.com

  # Avoid in favor of {#redirect_to} when possible.
  #
  # @example Block google ads.
  #   run proc {|uri, extras|

  #   }
  # @param url [String] the substitute url

  # Hijack the request and generate a dynamic reply.
  # This can be used to skip landing pages,
  # change the behaviour of a website depending on the browser's headers or to
  # generate an entire virtual website using your favorite Rack framework.
  #
  # The block is called inside a fiber, so you can easily perform asynchronous tasks.
  # If the return value is a Rack triplet, it will be sent to the browser.

  #   With great power comes great responsibility.
  #   Please respect the privacy of your users.
  # @example Hello World
  #   run proc {|uri, extras|
  #     intercept {|req, res|
  #       [200, {}, 'Hello World']
  #     }
  #   }
  # @yieldparam req [Rack::Request] the browser request
  # @yieldparam res [Thin::AsyncResponse] the response to send back
  # @yieldreturn Rack triplet or anything else
  # @raise [Action]
